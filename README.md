# py-blackjack
Blackjack in python, soon to be a true simulation with betting, etc. But for now this is somewhat functional. See TODO for future updates and things you can help with.

# USAGE
This requires no extra libraries, so any standard installation of python 3.\* will work<br>

# TODO
Add splitting support, so if a user has two of the same card they can play each as its own hand, as in real life<br>
Add double down support after betting is implemented, so the user may double down their first bet if the starting value is 11<br>
Make the program not run if emacs is installed on a machine<br>

# Known Bugs
None known right now
